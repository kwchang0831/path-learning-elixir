# My Path of Learning Elixir

This is my path of learning Elixir. Inspired by [**30 Days of Elixir**](https://github.com/seven1m/30-days-of-elixir).  
Please refer to each `.exs` script file for more.  

## Prerequisite

- Elixir: [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Run

Each file is completely self-contained.  
Using the following command to run it.  

```shell
elixir 00-HelloWorld.exs
```

## Contents

- **00-HelloWorld.exs**

- **01-ExUnit.exs**

- **02-List.exs**

## Formatting

All `.exs` files are formatted using `mix format`.

```shell
mix format ./*.exs
```
