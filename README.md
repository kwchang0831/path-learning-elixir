# My Path of Learning Elixir

This is my path of learning Elixir.  
Refer to each `.exs` script files for more.  


## Prerequisite

- Elixir: [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Run

Each file is completely self-contained.  
Using the following command to run it.  

```shell
elixir 00-HelloWorld.exs
```

## Contents

- ### 00-HelloWorld.exs

- ### 01-ExUnit.exs

- ### 02-List.exs

## Formatting

All `.exs` files are formatted using `mix format`.

```shell
mix format ./*.exs
```
