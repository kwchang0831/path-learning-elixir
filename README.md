# My Path of Learning Elixir

This is my path of learning Elixir.  
Refer to each `.exs` script files for more.  
Each file is completely self-contained.

## Run and Expected Ouput

### 00-HelloWorld.exs

```shell
❯ elixir 00-HelloWorld.exs
Hello World from Elixir
```

### 01-ExUnit.exs

```shell
> elixir 01-ExUnit.exs
........

Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.09s on load, 0.01s async, 0.00s sync)
8 tests, 0 failures
```

## Formating

All `.exs` files are formatted using `mix format`.

```shell
mix format ./*.exs
```
